}
\arguments{
\item{B}{Number of trees.}

\item{n}{Number of subjects in each bootstrap sample.}

\item{X_training}{Features of the training data.}

\item{Y_training}{Supervisor of the training data.}

}
\value{
A trained net random forest model that contains the predicted response values,
clustering memberships as well as a list of trees and selected features used in each tree.
}
\description{
Performs spectral clustering outside of all trees of the random forest on the training data.
